This directory contains source code for ternary search tree
(`TernarySearchTree.java`) and Smith-Waterman local alignment
(`SmithWaterman.java`). To compile you'll need at least Java 1.5.

```
javac -cp . *.java
```

Each file is self-executable; i.e., try executing the following

```
java -cp . TernarySearchTree
java -cp . SmithWaterman "testosterone undecanoate" "TESTOSTERONE DECANOATE"
```

Feel free to contact me at `nguyenda@mail.nih.gov` should you have any
problems.
